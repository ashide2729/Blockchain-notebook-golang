To get started with first clone the ethereum project for golang and set it up using the guide:

git clone <link>
cd go-ethereum
git checkout tags/v<latest version> -b <some name>

// Install golang

"make all" in the go-ethereum directory

Now the next step is to create a genesis block(the first block):

mkdir <some name>
cd 
gedit <some name>.json for your genesis block to define properties
the json file contains properties like timestamp, difficulty, parenthash, coinabse etc to setup the block accordingly
Inittialise the blockchain using init .json file that was created earlier
start the geth console`

That is it your blockchain dev setup is done.

Now once you run the geth console you will see the terminal show arrow to run commands.
These commands are ethereum developed commands to perform certain operation which you can run to perform different operations on the blocks.
